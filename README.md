### Personal flakes for NixOS setup. (ASUS FX507ZU4)

### CAUTION! 

- Nix files in syswide directory are system-wide configurations (asusctl, bootloader, fonts, timezones, users, etc....) and the ones in home directory are home manager explicit options.

### How to install!

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/nixuris/hyprnix.git
```

Copy hardware-configuration in:

```
cd hyprnix
rm syswide/core/hardware-configuration.nix
sudo cp /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix syswide/core
```

Apply changes system wide:

```
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#nixos
```

Assuming in the same directory as flake.nix and your hostname is 'nixos'.

Then set up home manager:

```
home-manager switch --flake ~/hyprnix#nixuris@nixos
```

Assuming username is 'nixuris'.
