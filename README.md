### Hyprland configuration for NixOS with additional personal use case.

> [!CAUTION] 
> I suggest looking into nixos/user/env/hyprland.nix to see what needs to be installed if you want to implement it yourself!
> Since this is a personal configuration, if you want to use my gtk settings in home-manager, remember to change to your name and the version to your system version!

Remember to add channel for home-manager and the nixos channel by choice (ex. unstable):

```
sudo nix-channel --add https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-unstable nixos
```
And build it:

```
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade
```

Then add channel for home manager for nvim and gtk theme management:

```
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager
nix-channel --update
home-manager switch
```

If the shell shows weird characters like '5u' then execute this command:

```
set -Ux fish_features no-keyboard-protocols
```
